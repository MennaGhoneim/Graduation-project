                <h3>Why does breast density matter?</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">breast denisty as a breasct cancer risk factor</p>
                <p>If you&apos;ve got dense breasts, it can be harder for radiologists to detect breast cancer when they&apos;re reading your mammogram. This is because cancers typically show up as white spots or masses on a mammogram and dense breast tissue also appears white on a mammogram. Just as it would be hard to spot a polar bear in a blizzard, this makes it hard to tell the difference between normal, healthy tissue and abnormal tissue. Fatty breast tissue appears dark on a mammogram, so it&apos;s easier to see white spots that may represent abnormal tissue.<br><br> Mammograms can miss about half of cancers in women with dense breasts. 2 In addition, women with dense breasts are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer within a year of receiving a normal mammogram result 3, usually based on symptoms such as a lump or other breast changes. <br><br> Besides hiding cancers on mammograms, dense breast tissue itself is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Doctors aren&apos;t sure exactly why. Cancers often develop in glandular tissue. The more glandular tissue there is, the greater the risk. <br><br> Generally, the more dense breast tissue you have, the higher your risk of breast cancer. It’s important to remember that most women are in the middle two categories of breast density (category B or C). People with extremely dense breast tissue (category D) have double the risk of breast cancer than those who have scattered fibroglandular density (category B).  <br><br> If you have dense breasts, you and your doctor can talk about this and any other risk factors for breast cancer that you may have. Such risk factors include a family history of breast and other cancers, genetic mutations associated with higher breast cancer risk, and prior radiation treatment to the chest area as an adolescent or young woman. <br><br> “Risk in and of itself is multifactorial: it depends on other risk factors you might have in addition to dense breast tissue,” says Maxine Jochelson, MD, director of radiology at the Breast and Imaging Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. “If breast density is your only risk factor, that&apos;s one thing, but if there are additional risk factors, that&apos;s different.”</p>
