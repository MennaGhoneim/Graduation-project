                <h3>Age at first menustrual as a breast risk factor</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">Breast Cancer Risk Factors: Age at First Menstrual Period</p>
                <p>Starting menstrual periods at a young age is linked to a small increase in breast cancer risk [13,17,19-21].Women who begin their periods before age 11 have about a 15% to 20% higher risk of breast cancer than women who begin their periods at age 15 or older [21].A pooled analysis of data from more than 100 studies found for every year younger a woman was when she began her period, her breast cancer risk increased by 5% [20]. <br><br> <b>Age at first period, estrogen and breast cancer risk</b> <br><br> The increased risk of breast cancer linked to a younger age at first period is likely due, at least in part, to the amount of estrogen a woman is exposed to in her life. A higher lifetime exposure to estrogen is linked to an increased breast cancer risk [22].The earlier a woman starts having periods, the longer her breast tissue is exposed to estrogens released during the menstrual cycle. This means a greater lifetime exposure to estrogen.A woman can&apos;t change the age when she started her period, but the age a girl starts her period can be impacted by certain healthy lifestyle factors. For example, girls who are lean and get more exercise tend to start their periods at a later age than other girls. It&apos;s a good idea for all young girls to be physically active and not be overweight. However, it&apos;s not recommended girls do anything to try to change when they first begin having their periods.</p>
