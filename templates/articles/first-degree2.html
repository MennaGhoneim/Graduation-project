                <h3>first-degree relatives (mother, sister or daughter) as a risk factor</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">A family history of cancer</p>
                    <p>Some faulty genes that increase the risk of cancer can be passed on from parent to child. These are inherited cancer gene faults. They occur when there is a fault in the genes in an egg or sperm cell at the time of conception. These faults in the initial sperm or egg cell are copied into every single cell in the body. The faulty genes can then pass from generation to generation. They are called germline mutations.We inherit genes from both our parents. If a parent has a gene fault, then each child has a 1 in 2 chance (50%) of inheriting it. So, some children will have the faulty gene and an increased risk of developing cancer and some children won’t.Being born with inherited faulty genes doesn’t mean that a person will definitely get cancer. But they have a higher risk of developing particular types of cancer than other people. They are also more likely to develop cancer at a younger age. Doctors call this having a genetic predisposition to cancer. For a cancer to develop, further gene changes (mutations) need to happen. This usually happens over many years.
                        Most people who have relatives with cancer will not have inherited a faulty gene. Cancer mostly occurs in older people. It is a common disease. 1 in 2 people in the UK (50%) born after 1960 will be diagnosed with some form of cancer during their lifetime. So, most families will have at least one person who has or has had cancer. Having a couple of relatives diagnosed with cancer doesn’t mean there is a cancer gene fault running in the family.
                        The strength of your family history depends on:
                        <ul>
                            <li>who in your family has had cancer</li>
                            <li>the types of cancer they have had</li>
                            <li>how old they were at diagnosis</li>
                            <li>how closely related the relatives with cancer are to each other</li>
                        </ul>
                        The more relatives who have had the same or related types of cancer, and the younger they were at diagnosis, the stronger someone&apos;s family history is. This means that it is more likely that the cancers are being caused by an inherited faulty gene.This family tree shows a pattern of cancer that could be caused by an inherited faulty gene. <br> You may have a strong family history if some of the following situations apply to you: 
                        <ul>
                        <li>the cancers developed when the family members were young , for example below the age of 50 for breast, bowel and womb cancer</li>
                        <li>multiple close relatives on the same side of your family have had cancer , the same side of your family means either your father&apos;s relatives or your mother&apos;s relatives</li>
                        <li>the relatives have had the same type of cancer, or different cancers that can be caused by the same gene fault</li>
                        <li>one of your relatives has had a gene fault found by genetic tests</li>
                        </ul>
                        It is important to remember that cancer is most common in older people. Each year more than a third (36%) of all cancer cases in the UK are diagnosed in people aged 75 and over. Cancer in older people is less likely to be due to an inherited cancer gene.</p>
